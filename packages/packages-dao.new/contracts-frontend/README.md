# Admin & Minting pages for your create-nft-dao

This package contains implementation of 2 pages useful for interacting with your NFT DAO clone.

1. `/admin` - admin page

   Used to manage your contracts, e.g enable minting, change mint price, release funds, etc. Only the creator of the NFT DAO can perform these operations.

2. `/` - minting page

   A page where users can mint tokens

These pages are meant as an example. Feel free to fork & extend.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo (or fork & clone)

   `$ git clone git@github.com:daocity/create-nft-dao.git`

2. Install dependencies

   `$ yarn`

3. Update config file

   Open `packages/contracts-frontend/config.ts` for editing.

   3.1 Set `CHAIN_ID` to the chain you are working on (e.g `ChainId.Rinkeby` or `ChainId.Mainnet`)

   3.2 Update contracts address for the chain you are working on. You need to update `tokenAddress`, `minterAddress`, `governorAddress` & `timelockAddress`.

   3.3 Update `minterType` to the type of minter you have chosed. Options are: `MinterType.FixedPriceSequentialMinter` or `MinterType.FixedPriceSpecificIDMinter`

4. Create `packages/contracts-frontend/.env` file similar to the `.env.example` file in the same folder.
